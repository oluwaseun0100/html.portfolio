    <h1>Works and Projects</h1>
            <h2><li>Tindog Website</li></h2> 
            <p>Imagine your dog finding a love partner online, sounds fun rightðŸ˜‰? Just like Tinder, Tindog helps you pet find love from the comfort of your couch. This was one of the fun projects I did while learning on Udemy.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/11.3%20TinDog%20Project/index.html#">The Tindog Website</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2><li>Hotel Website</li></h2>
            <p>A beautiful Web design for an Hotel yet to exist--I might be the one to build it though, or if you have one already, I can build your Hotel's Website for you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="./images/Hotel-images.html">Website Preview</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2><li>Mondrian Projects</li></h2>
            <p>This was quite a tricky one to work on--I felt more like a Mathematician calculating dimensions, but it was fun and constructive to work on.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/10.3%20Mondrian%20Project/Modrian%20practice.html">Project 1</a></li>
                <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/10.3%20Mondrian%20Project/index.html">Project 2</a></li>
            </ul>    
            <h2><li>Drum Kit Website</li></h2>
            <p>Why use sticks to drum when you have a Website that can do that? I worked with Javascript on this one and it was very interesting--if you ever need to learn how to drum, I'm always ready.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/Drum+Kit+Starting+Files/Drum%20Kit%20Starting%20Files/index.html">Drum Kit</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2><li>Dice Game</li></h2>
            <p>A very fun game to play with a friend. Refresh your page to play.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/Dicee+Challenge+-+Completed/Dicee%20Challenge%20-%20Completed/dicee.html">Dice Game</a></li>
            </ul>
            <h2><li>Transportation Company Website</li></h2>
            <p>Ever need to move your load, checkout this online Website where you can quickly contact a moving company who are on standby to serve you.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="http://127.0.0.1:3000/11.2%20Bootstrap%20Components/index.html#">A Transportation Company Website</a></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Also, I have worked on other projects like <strong>Fabonacci Calculator, Love compactability detector, IBM Calculator</strong>  amongst others.</p>
        <p class="bottom">Currently, the projects may not be as impressive as you would like, but they will surely be updated with more amazing and interactive websites.</p>
